# TrueSight

Taylor Moyle, Patrick Dixon

Facial recognition AI, coded in Python and inspired by TensorFlow and OpenCV.

Main.py implemeneted a hand-coded CNN  to classify if an image contained 1+ face or not. 
Main_cv2.py utilized pre-trained models to localize facial landmarks, detect faces, and recognize existing users to alleviate the time/hardware constraints associated with training multiple complex neural networks.
